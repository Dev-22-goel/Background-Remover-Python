# Background-Remover-Python
Working like zoom, I can alter the background to whatever I want. It also catches the FPS.  To have a white background (255,255,255) can be set. 

**Background Remover** is a python tool which is removes the obstacles from the background during a video call. It is very much similar to zoom where the user is seen in different backgrounds
